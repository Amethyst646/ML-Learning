## Demented and Nondemented Classification
---
### Project Overview

  This project involves developing a Machine Learning model to classify patients as demented or non-demented. It is conducted independently using data from the [MRI and Alzheimer's Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers?select=oasis_longitudinal.csv). 

  **Objectives** :  This project focuses on understanding each steps and detailed structured of how-to in developing a machine learning model and its deployment. 
  Steps implemented include: 
  - `Data Collection`
  - `Data Preprocessing`
  - `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`
  - `Feature Engineering`
  - `Model Selection`
  - `Hyperparameter Tuning`
  - `Model Training`
  - `Model Evaluation`
  - `Model Deployment`
