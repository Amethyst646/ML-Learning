## Demented and Nondemented Classification
---
### Project Overview

  This project involves developing a Machine Learning model to classify patients as demented or non-demented. It is conducted independently using data from the [MRI and Alzheimer's Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers?select=oasis_longitudinal.csv). 

  **Objectives** :  The primary goal for this project is to understand each step in the machine learning development processes, creating a structured guide for developing and deploying the demented vs non-demented classification model. Key steps covered in this project are as follows: 
  - `Data Collection`: Gathering and organizing relevant data for model development and training
  - `Data Preprocessing`: Cleaning and preparation stage before proceeding to the analysis stage.
  - `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Analyzing the prepared data through visualization and identifying correlations or patterns within variables.
  - `Feature Engineering`: Feature selection to improve efficiency and model accuracy.
  - `Model Selection`: Testing and choosing the most suitable model for classification.
  - `Hyperparameter Tuning`: Optimizing model parameters to enhance model performance using various techniques.
  - `Model Training`: Training the selected model to learn patterns.
  - `Model Evaluation`: Evaluating and giving assesment on model accuracy and effectiveness using several evaluation metrics.
  - `Model Deployment`: Deploying the model to make prediction in a production setting.
